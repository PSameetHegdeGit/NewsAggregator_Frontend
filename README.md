# News Aggregator Frontend

Developed in Angular and uses Angular Material for UI Design. News-Aggregator's Front End communicates with a backend developed in Flask. Backend returns JSON load to Front End on Front End's query. Front End renders data into mat-cards. 

In the future, I hope to connect News Aggregator with a MongoDB database as well as set up the settings page and personal feed!

Deployed on Heroku.
